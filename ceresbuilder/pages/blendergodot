    <p>Learning new things from scratch is a long process hampered mostly by not knowing what best practices are, while at the same time developing an efficient workflow tailored to your own skills and intrests. If you aren't being taught best practices and a workflow, progress is slow.</p>
    <p>However I'm motivated by want to be able to create, even if it takes a long time. Working out a style, standards and a workflow is done over many years of trial and error.</p>

You end up fiddling with little details to get the effect right, working pixel by pixel, and taking up a lot of time.</span></figure>
        <figure><button><picture><img src="static/img/blendergodot-3.jpg" alt="sculpted model of a duck in blender on the left, and the same model 3D printed and sanded smooth on the right" /></picture></button><span>Working in very high resolutions ironically speeds up the process. Sculpting in Blender requires working at hundreds of thousands of vertices, but when exporting, the model can be decimated to make it more manageable.</span></figure>

        <figure><button><picture><img src="static/img/blendergodot-5.jpg" alt="Left: 3D printed duck being held up to a lamp, lighting up because it's hollow. Right: The huge mesh in Rhino" /></picture></button><span>Millipede's remeshing tool, via Rhino, helped rationalise a gigantic mesh into something that could be worked with. This duck had to be hollow and fit with other parts, but the mesh had to have enough detail that sanding after printing would produce a good finish.</span></figure>
        <figure><button><picture><img src="static/img/blendergodot-7.jpg" alt="flat-looking, rectangular doors in Blender, in a sort of pixel art style" /></picture></button><span>Because of not knowing better, I UVed these models by placing every single face's UV coordinates by hand on the texture, pixel by pixel. Despite being such simple looking models, I spent days of work on these, fiddling with the textures and the topology granularly.</span></figure>

To make it feel more homely, the colour and strength of light in the scene has to be changed" /></picture></button><span>Godot's default ambient lighting has a bluish colour that tints everything and makes textures look flat. Getting the right appearance is also trial and error, fiddling with roughness and metallic maps on models and environmental and shader settings.</span></figure>
        <figure><button><picture><img src="static/img/blendergodot-4.jpg" alt="A candle, showing how the flame is just a flat image that glows brightly and always faces the camera" /></picture></button><span>Making a bright flame and a candle glow makes use of emissive map textures that tell the renderer where light is shining. The flame is a flat image that rotates to face the camera, and wiggles by spawning and fading away over and over.</span></figure>

These were done over about 2 weeks and developed to be rigged. Every successive attempt fixes problems with the previous and helped me understand more about how human retopology is supposed to work.</span></figure>
