    <h2>Childrens' Hospital Waiting Room</h2>
    <span>Interior design project for a paediatric hospital entrance.<br>Ceres Miller, 2019</span>

    <p>Providing children nooks and places to hide while being visible to staff and guardians, and hiding the reception desk out of immediate view when entering the room, creates a feeling of homliness and safety to help put patients at ease.</p>

    <p>There is tactical use of light and pattern all over the space. As a visitor enters, the direction of the floorboards and ceiling tiles, as well as a line of ceiling lights, point them towards the back of the room towards the reception desk. A skylight above the reception helps light it up as the center of the room.</p>
    <p>Celestory lighting and tree decals with lots of vertical lines help create waiting spaces that feel secluded and still, to calm people waiting.</p>

    <p>A clear separation of transit and waiting spaces in a children's hospital helps keep toys and books out of the way of anybody moving. The two waiting areas have whole walls dedicated to entering and exiting them, minimising bottleneck-based tripping risks.</p>
