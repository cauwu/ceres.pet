    <p>This website developed from a design language I was using for a tech support guides website I had made for an organisation I volunteered for between 2020 and 2023. That took from <a href="https://js.wiki/"><u>Wiki.js</u></a>, and so the original aim was that I'd build something that turned markdown pages into webpages. That never materalised, as I enjoyed the flexibility I could get from just writing webpages by hand. Historically, that's what HTML was designed for, anyway.</p>
    <p>The language involved a narrow, centered reader column, with site and page information surrounding it that could altogether fit on a 4:3 resolution screen. For mobile screens the site adapts natively, the reader column has no problem displaying everything on a narrow screen and all the surrounding site and page links fall inline.</p>
    <p>I have maintained this language into my portfolio site. I think it looks neat and professional, and is highly compatible with a variety of screens, browsers and devices. It loads on a Nintendo DS, even.</p>

    <span>Project to rewrite this website for a static site engine<br>Ceres Miller, Sept 2024</span>
    <hr>
    <p>Currently to add a page to my website I copy+paste one of the HTML files I've already written and replace everything inside the &#60;article&#62; tag with the page content I want to write. This leaves things like the site footer, the navigation links, the page structure etc standard across my site, but means that if I for whatever reason want to change something in those links or that structure (say, for example, add a new button) I have to go through every single page I have and write it in for each one.</p>
    <p>This is fine, if a little tedious, for a site with only a handful of pages (like mine) but if that number of pages grows, it can become impossible to keep them consistent with each other.</p>
    <p>What <a href="https://www.getzola.org/"><u>Zola</u></a> and other static site engines do is automatically re-generate those HTML pages every time you run the program, using a template you provide. This means instead of me copy+pasting a HTML file and replacing everything inside &#60;article&#62; with what I want to post, I provide the post seperately, just how it would be if I wrote it in the HTML file, and Zola builds the page for me using the footer or links or page structure I give it from some authoratitive, single source.</p>
    <p>This means that I can make hundreds of pages, and if I want to change things about them, I can do that all together.</p>
    <p>In industry, this has the effect that people can write for a website easier and faster. Things like page contents lists can be generated automatically for an article rather than an author needing to write them out themselves. In fact, an author doesn't even need to write using HTML anymore; the article content can be converted from a faster-to-write format like Markdown.</p>
    <p>But I don't need to do that. All I need to do to migrate my website to Zola is write the template and then pull out all the articles from my pages. Then, every time I send website changes to Github, the website will be automatically rebuilt by Zola.</p>

    <h2 id="subheading03">Not Migrating to Zola and Instead Just Writing My Own Site Builder</h2>
    <span>I don't want to write markdown files<br>Ceres Miller, Oct 2024</span>
    <hr>
    <p>I had written my website so that everything was the same between pages except what's inside the &#60;article&#62; tag and some extra lines in the head of the Mind's Eye page to make the .3mf viewer work. To migrate my website to Zola, I'd need to rewrite every article in Markdown, and then style that markdown properly so that it matched the CSS I have right now, and then make all the other little changes with the learning curves that come with them just to get something that I didn't really need or want; I value the flexibility of having written my website entirely on my own, because the main reason I chose to do so in the first place was because I couldn't find <a href="https://gohugo.io"><u>Hugo</u></a> templates I liked.</p>
    <p>I had been putting off the Zola migration for 5 months and when I finally got round to it I realised that if I wanted to make webpages with variable styling from the others (useful for if I wanted to have a portfolio section, a blog section, UI prototypes, etc) then Zola would make that more difficult than if I was to just not use it.</p>
    <p>All I needed was a tool for stitching HTML fragments together and I could do that with any programming or scripting language that can concatenate strings; take blocks of text and stick them end to end in the right place. I was already using Javascript for bits and pieces on my website, and in Javascript I can easily select HTML elements and change them. I would build a tool in Javascript that would take a list of text files, read them as strings, and then use a template to put those bits of text in the right place.</p>
    <p>It helps</p>
