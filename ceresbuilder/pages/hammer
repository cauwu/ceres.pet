    <span>A TTT map that isn't very fun to play, but fun to add to<br>Ceres Miller, 2020-2024</span>
    <hr>
    <p>Every few years I'll come back to this map and spend 2 weeks doubling it in size. It's a map for a multiplayer shooter game based on the rules of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)"><u>Mafia,</u></a> (or Werewolf, or Town of Salem, or Among Us, or any of the other versions) called <a href="https://www.troubleinterroristtown.com/"><u>Trouble in Terrorist Town, or TTT.</u></a></p>
    <p>The rules of the game necessitate hiding, deception, and moving from place to place quickly and unknown by the other players if you're the traitor, as well as finding ways to split people off from the group to kill them without anybody noticing until you're away from the scene with an alibi. If you're an innocent terrorist, you're searching for weapons, encountering people unexpectedly, and trying to stay alert for when somebody else gets killed.</p>
    <div class="portfoliorow">
        <button><picture><img src="static/img/bunny-01.jpg" alt="a soft toy rabbit sitting" /></picture></button>
    </div>
    <p>The map is a maze that always leads back to the beginning, there are no dead ends. This helps prevent dead zones that nobody visits, and helps speed up the process of searching for stragglers near the end of the game. Places to hide, spots to wait unseen and in turn spots to counter those spots are all over the map. Spaces lead from tight corridors and stairways to wide chambers with many levels, helping keep the pace of gameplay quick and terrifying. The map is meant to give the impression that you're 4 years old, running around the aisles of a store or public building trying to catch your brother, frightening each other every time you turn a corner.</p>
    <p>Rooms are visually distinct and there are lots of places for a detective to summon people to line up. There's enough going on that every game feels different gameplay wise, and someone will see something new after many games; a room they haven't seen before, a new path, a secret behind a door, all without the map feeling too big, too cramped, or unfair.</p>

    </div>
    <p>The style of the map comes from me recreating places from memory or from pictures, with some alterations and adaptations. Together, they are incoherent and on their face don't lend themselves to any kind of good level design. I had no style I was keeping to with this map, and so I developed some rules that I thought would be fun to lean into the incoherence:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>In each room, lay out as many hints as possible as to the setting using theming (what the exterior may look like, what the room is used for) and then contradict each one of them as quickly as possible. (A bunker-like rec room with a stained, ugly carpet leads through a dimly lit canteen kitchen into a tacky hotel lobby, up the stairs of the lobby is a hotel room with a ladder into the ceiling, and in the ceiling, there is a hospital corridor. There is no real sense of how these rooms work, and so, how to move through them, your own intuitive wayfinding falls short, you gain an eerie sense of placelessness and claustrophobia)</li>
        <li>As often as possible, have the player traverse many contrasting, incoherent places on one path, to make understanding the map more compliciated, however, engaging. (Eg, through a door in a hotel lobby, down a set of gloomy stairs into the ceiling of a dimly lit bathroom, then crouch and jump down onto the toilet, then there are two doors to exit that both lead into the same warehouse, that leads down another set of stairs.)</li>
        <li>Do everything possible to confuse the player's sense of direction and elevation. Have them climb up and down stairs, ladders and elevators constantly, and then throw off a player's sense of where they are in relation to other rooms using path loops and spirals. Create as many loops as possible to prevent just hugging the wall to find direction.</li>
        <li>The map has no windows, and where windows are needed, they should have fluorescent lamps in them.</li>
        <li>If there's space to connect two areas that are next to each other, connect them, in as strange and contrived a way as possible to make maintaining direction harder. (through vents, false ceilings, twisting behind walls).</li>
        <li>In one sightline, the player should never see more than two areas at once, to make them use their memory as much as possible for where things are.</li>
        <li>Create a sense of distrust in the environment in the player by using false walls and doors, easily missed crawlspaces, dead angles, and narrow, twisting corridors that connect between big rooms and atriums in unpredictable ways. A big room with a lot of detail and theming in it feels special, and if it's hard to find in plain sight, it creates a lot of depth in the atmosphere that makes players suspect there's things (and other players) hidden everywhere, unpredictably.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So the map turned into a study of disorentation and using wayfinding hints and cues from level design and interior design to mislead people as thoroughly as possible. However, the map still had to avoid people getting frustrated with it, so I added lots of destructible elements like windows and vents so that people could feel as if they're forcing the map to be comprehended, and so they could navigate it easier by breaking open their own shortcuts. Above all, there's no way to get stuck anywhere in this map, because so long as you just keep walking, you'll always end up back where you started.</p>

    <p>I later on realised that there are so many blind corners and dead angles in this map that it really doesn't make a very good FPS level. There are too many places that players can get shot from that they feel as if they're powerless to avoid. So, I suppose, time to move on to the next project.</p>
    <p>When I started making this map, I wanted to use the area portals from the Portal 2 version of the Source engine to make rooms with impossible and intersecting geometry, like The Stanley Parable did, but area portals were not available in the Garry's Mod version of Source, so I tried to create the same feeling using strictly legal and possible geometry. That was the inspiration of this map.</p>

    <span>Endless hobby projects<br>Ceres Miller, 2024</span>
    <hr>
    <p><a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Valve_Hammer_Editor"><u>Valve Hammer Editor</u></a> is a level design tool for Source engine video games. It was released as part of the Source SDK, a public release version of some of the Valve (a game design company) in-house development tools, in 2004 along with Half-Life 2 to let modders make custom content for that game.</p>
    <p>For the next 19 years, Valve and other companies given permission to develop for the Source engine, used this version of Hammer (4.x) to build levels. In 2023, along with Counter-Strike 2, a new version of Hammer (5.x) for an overhauled version of Source released.</p>
    <p>What makes the Hammer 4.x and Source combination so intresting is that the software architecture and design practices for video games that Hammer and Source are built on no longer exist in the video game industry. Teams are much larger now and the people in them much more specialised, so there's no need for a level designer to do all the prototyping, blockout work, geometry, texturing, level scripting, and compliation in one tool. Yet because of this, because of the now outmoded ways of working that Hammer was designed for, it means that one person can very quickly prototype, test and play a multiplayer FPS level very easily.</p>
    <p>The art direction has changed as the game design industry has developed too. With newer rendering technology that can depict complex, moving lights very quickly and efficiently, modern games can more realistically approximate different climate and weather effects, like fog, or light dappling through moving leaves, or a rising and setting sun. Older games rely on lighting technology that's more meant for particular scenarios and types of places, more up to artist's impression, that's pre-calculated and still. Lighting is always tweaked game-to-game to suit the style, setting, and environment of a particular project, but for people who are not engineers or occupational game designers, learning the maths involved is beyond the scope of their hobby. Rendering light automatically with default settings in public engines like Godot, Unity and Unreal can make environments and objects look incongruent and hollow, as if most structures don't cast ambient shadows properly. Source was designed at a time that players, unfamiliar with 3D graphics, would sometimes struggle to quickly recognise what they were looking at on the screen. Things like objects, paths and obstacles needed to be clearly and accurately defined, rooms and places had to feel different from one another, and so that meant, among other design elements, that there needed to be lots of detailed texture information and accurate-to-life illumination. Valve designed a lighting system that produced deep, moody shadows and soft ambient light, making everything feel like it's in a wet, cold climate under an overcast sky that produces flat, diffuse light; like the Pacific Northwest of the USA, where their offices are, and like northern and eastern Europe. This style is a favourite of urban explorers, and artists and photographers trying to give the impression of eerie stillness, a gloom that seems to lend itself to storytelling, at least in my opinion.</p>
    <p>Source is in the particular position of being a publicly available game engine, built for multiplayer by default, with level design tools meant for small, multi-skill teams that test and iterate quickly, and can make urban and interior environments look true-to-life enough to be parsed and understood in terms of depth, distance and material in no time. This is Source's, and Hammer's, persistent appeal.</p>
