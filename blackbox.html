                            <p>Craft practice is a social process. It requires a craft practitioner to be constantly learning from others, constantly exhibiting and looking for feedback, and constantly exploring their surroundings and themselves for what makes their practice unique.</p>
                            <p>Craft practitioners form communities of teaching, learning and exhibition. Those communities forge friendships and love, life-defining skills and hobbies, and social groups that support each other.</p>
                            <p>Black Box is a speculative project about a craft community forming around handmade digital electronics.</p>

                            <p>It's hard to learn about digital electronics. This project began as a way to explore that learning process and find out what what can motivate people to learn and make for themselves, in a hobby setting.</p>
                            <p>I undertook it in a nonscientific way. I darted around concepts, introducing things through prototyping and testing. I didn't start with an analysis of the conditions of learning digital electronics as a hobby, I relied on my own prior experiences and the experiences of people that I knew. It's not a scientific project, and I never set out to prove a point, but rather to see where the prototyping and asking questions took me, hoping to end up with a design project by the end of it.</p>
                            <p>This way of working made it difficult to know what I should focus on. It kept me motivated by keeping my options open for how to develop the project, but I lacked clear aims and bases, so planning ahead and evaluating my work was difficult. I spent a lot of time researching things I didn't need to get into, like pedagogy, which was not what my project was about, and found it difficult to stay on track with the core of what I wanted to do.</p>
                            <p>I found that I needed to apply constraints to my project at different stages as it progressed. I didn't know how my project would turn out at the end when I began it, and working in the aimless way I did made progress difficult, but each step I took nonetheless moved my project closer to something resolved.</p>

                            <p>The first milestone was my decision to focus on craft practice. Where my project's research question at this point was <i>Nonstandard Ways of Making Digital Electronics</i>, focussing on craft practice allowed me to study the methods of craft practitioners and give some direction to my project; beginning to develop how it would turn out and the type of issue it would be exploring.</p>
                            <p>This choice of craft came from my physical making. To address my research question, I had been working with hand tools like soldering and embroidery for electronic materials, trying to make things that looked new, with the aim of presenting the experience of learning about digital electronics in a way that some people may find easier to grasp.</p>
                            <p>Using the craft practice documented by Michael Shorter in his paper about his PhD, <i>Craft Technologist</i>, (2014) I was able to hone down my project with choices that dimensioned it. Shorter pointed out the importance of the craft practitioner studying deeply their chosen materials and methods and experimenting with them as far as possible, so at this point I chose brass wire and soldering to study.</p>
                            <p>Basing my work off of the existing and recent practice of other designers is an extremely valuable way to begin a body of research. Building on someone else's understandings I believe is an efficient and collaborative approach to design learning and development of specialised skills. It fits with the belief that many people working in a similar field is a vital driver of innovation, through derivation and adaption. This is an idea that I would introduce properly into my project for the final concept.</p>

                            <p>I tested the effectiveness of these objects I had made at helping people to understand digital electronics with a focus on modification and making by running workshops with people intrested in learning about digital electronics. Showing my work to people and asking them about it allowed me to gain their opinions and insights about what I was doing, not just whether it was effective. People's suggestions for what they wanted to see became integral to the development of my work.</p>
                            <p>People getting involved with what I was doing guided my project. Shorter's <i>Craft Technologist</i> places importance on exhibition and feedback, but the idea of working socially, or even developing work as part of a community, is something that I knew my project should be exploring. Computers are seemingly infinitely complex, and an expert can hyper-specialise in an aspect of their field or their own work that really only they understand. Sharing knowlege, working cooperatively, is how tech work gets done, and even in the hobby space, only a small number of people can really understand how a particular microcontroller works deeply. Because of this, communities of tech-makers form, to share information, exhibit their work, find opportunities, and get feedback. How these communities function to make meaningful and innovative things is an intresting area to explore in a design project.</p>

                            </div>
                            <p>Periodically through my project I assessed the value of what I'd done, from the perspective of something marketable, or art, or research. What I decided that value to be changed over time; initially I had thought what I was doing could assist learning, then later it was make people think of digital electronics differently, then as a rapid prototyping system, and finally as a speculative project exploring a digital electronics community. The change between each of these was motivated by constant testing of what I made with people, and feedback from them about my project. Working in this way not only motivated me to change and keep developing, but gave me vital information about what people want to see and experience. What I made is as much my own product as it is the product of my surroundings and the people who gave me feedback on it.</p>
                            <p>I collected and processed people's thoughts in a structured way. During workshops I took notes on what people said, suggested, or were intested in, including their actions. I also asked research questions. To process this qualitative information into quantitative data, I used a modified version of Thematic Analysis. Where thematic analysis first requires a researcher to sort the data into <i>themes</i> and then assign those themes meanings, I was able to skip this part because of the limited dataset I had collected and that I already had a familiarity with the meaning of each data point. I sorted the data into 2 groups; <i>affirmative</i> and <i>negative</i>, and counted how many points were in each in order to get results and make decisions.</p>
                            <p>Thematic analysis is a useful way of assessing the meaning of large amounts of data, but my conditions led me to modify the process. I still got useable and useful results, though not in a scientific way. Through this project, I did not take issue with doing things unscientifically, especially as from the outset, I did not know what my project was setting out to prove or even to discuss exactly. Regardless, I think I have produced something useful for others and worthwhile.</p>

                            <p>As my project came closer to being resolved, I researched the work of Italian designer Enzo Mari. In <i>Proposta per un'autoprogettazione</i> it was his Communist beliefs that led him to design a system for furniture that somebody could design on their own, a work process designed to reduce the alienation from labour experienced in a factory and blend work more closely into a person's personal life. This idea was hugely important for developing my thinking around how a craft community engages with the development of their work, that what makes craft production <i>craft</i> is the home, community and social influences folded into it. Craft work is inseperable from a practitioner's life. Although my project looks at production in a hobby setting, this aspect of craft is what makes thinking of what I make as being the products of craft useful.</p>
                            <p>Applying that to the speculative lens of my resolved project, I incorporate all that I learned so far about making handmade digital electronics; from learning how, to selecting mateials and methods, to production, into designed artefacts and paratext that show the experiences and culture of a craft community that makes digital electronics.</p>
                            <p>This project has the potential to encourage people to learn about, make and modify digital electronics by depicting a learning community, the people in it, and the things they make. Encouraging learning and development is something I wanted to do from the outset.</p>

                            <p>This project has had a chaotic and loose development, but progressed quickly. With constant feedback and advice from others, as well as an understanding of how to keep myself motivated and my own intrests, I was able to keep this project moving and develop it into a worthwhile body of research and design thinking.</p>
                            <p>My understanding of how to run a design and research project has significantly developed because of my work, and it has developed my understanding of my own practice. The theme of community and collaboration in making I brought to the forefront of this project both because I found it so helpful, and because others were intrested in seeing a project like this. This theme will likely be one I carry on for a long time.</p>
