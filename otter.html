							<p>This stuffed otter was made after the <a href="rabbit.html">soft toy rabbit</a> and improves upon it by using extra pieces for the head and face, helping make it rounder, less fish-eyed, and easier to pose at the neck.</p>

							<p>Making this was useful for understanding and improving on a workflow. Having worked with paper models for 2 of these projects, I feel confident in working in real space enough that doing the modelling with digital pattern cutting software or even unfolding 3D model meshes could be much faster.</p>

                            <p>As before I started with the head and worked downward. When beginning, I need to make sure the head is exactly how I want it, because it sets the scale for the rest of the toy. It's also the most expressive part of a body, animal or human, followed closely by the hands.</p>
							<p>It's worth noting that I never really measured any of the pieces. When getting seperate pieces to match up, I would guess the length of the edge, cut out the paper template, then try it on, and make adjustments as needed. When working with curves, I would make use of the length of a pencil or my hand to help. I did this for speed reasons, as I wanted to move as quickly as possible. When working with many complicated and small pieces, it can sometimes reduce measuring errors to just eyeball everything.</p>

							<p>I worked again all hand sewing. I only learned recently how to use a sewing machine, as I never had access to one, but as far as I know, when making little details a sewing machine is messier and more error prone than just hand sewing, especially on this high-pile sherpa fabric. A walking foot on a sewing machine can be used, as with any knit fabric, but many of the shapes I was using had corners that are too tight for a sewing machine anyway.</p>
							<p>A project later may be to make a toy that can be put together with a sewing machine, but I really value the expressiveness in shape that I can get by hand sewing.</p>

							<p>A faux leatherette was used for the paws and feet and details embroidered onto them with black wool. Embroidering by hand in this way is always a huge pain, because I use a very thick embroidery needle in order to fit the wool through, which makes pushing the needle through sometimes require a pair of pliers. I do the embroidery last because the stuffed shape is meant to change with the embroidery, in the case of the paws and flippers, the wool helps add definition.</p>
							<p>Leatherworkers will stamp a hole before sewing with thick thread. It is however hard to do this with knit fabrics. A round-tipped needle rather than a sharp one can prevent the needle going through the weave rather than the gaps between them, but a sharp pointed needle avoids getting stuck in the stuffing or the pile. Maybe the solution is just using pliers after all.</p>
							<br>
							<p>I think eventually I'd like to sell stuffed toys like these in small batches. Before that happens I need to get faster at making them, and I also need to explore the safety and longevity considerations of toymaking, as currently I use glass eyes rather than safety eyes, and the important shape of the head is formed like a cloth doll but without the thick wadded stuffing that prevents that shape from coming apart.</p>
