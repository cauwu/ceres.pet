A participant also said that they were less motivated to learn and more interested in the objects. Another said that the education was lacking a strong narrative—why should someone learn this? What are these logic gates used for? I had run the workshop in the context of a 4-bit adder, but nobody knew what that was before my explanation. All of this would imply that although my objects made for an enjoyable learning experience that worked on my participants, they themselves say that using these objects is not a good way to learn.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">My participants had asked for more interaction in these objects. They wanted them to work, to do something, to build something with them; like putting them together like building blocks to make something tangible. This suggests they wanted something out of my work that they were not getting. They found the teaching material being on slates made it much more engaging, but this isn’t that useful to my project.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Takeaways</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">People are very interested in the way that these models are presented and would like to see me do more with them.

The purpose of the workshop is to see what comes out of doing this in terms of physical artefacts, and if working with others is valuable. Specifically I want to know if what people make, when those objects are presented as having been made by people who didn’t know much about digital electronics, they make people feel differently about digital electronics.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The workshop takes around an hour. People sit down with lots of easy and quick to use material for making electronics; foamboard, conductive ink, copper tape, components (resistors, transistors, batteries, leds), hot glue, and pens. Participants will also be given foamboard shapes, I have made cubes, to use as something to get people thinking by narrowing down possibilities.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Participants, setting</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Participants were the same people who had done the previous workshop.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For what categories I was looking for; people who didn’t know much about electronics or digital electronics, but wanted to learn.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This workshop is done with me constantly participating in it alongside others.

I’ll talk constantly about what I’m doing to give the participants an idea of what they’re meant to be doing and thinking about too.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I’ll talk them through any ideas they have. Once they settle on something, I’ll help them figure out how it will work, and then help them build it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The whole time I’ll be noting down their experiences, reactions, and statements. I’m looking for their opinions about the experience, problems they have with it, things they want out of it, and if they’re enjoying what they’re doing/making.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 684.46px; height: 512.91px;"><img alt="" style="width: 911.42px; height: 512.91px; margin-left: -113.23px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title="" src="images/image7.png"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Materials used</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 688.60px; height: 429.87px;"><img alt="" style="width: 764.32px; height: 429.87px; margin-left: -37.85px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title="" src="images/image6.png"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Foamboard cubes used as a starting point</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">At the end of the hour we’ll look at what we did, and I’ll ask the participants questions:</span></p><ul class="c9 lst-kix_djr9dpsth35e-0 start"><li class="c2 c8 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Do you feel like physical making made you feel different now about digital electronics than before?</span></li><li class="c2 c8 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Would you be willing to do this kind of thing on your own, to make things for your own uses?</span></li><li class="c2 c8 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Did you enjoy the experience?</span></li></ul><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Method of Processing Results</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I took participants' responses and got their opinion on each point by reading their tone, excitement, and statements, both during and after the workshop.
