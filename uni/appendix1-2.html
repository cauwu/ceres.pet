class="c1">- do you think it would make you less anxious around webcams if you could physically see the wiring inside of it, the sensor, and the gap in the wiring when it&#39;s switched off, for example, in an object something like what I&#39;ve made</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- does seeing electronics presented in this way make you want to learn about how they work, does it intrigue you to see a webcam all blown up in wire like this</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- do you feel like you understand the webcam better seeing it like this</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The questions are obviously leading and not unbiased, but I wanted the responses to be conversational, as I was asking people I already knew and explained them my project.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p

student<br><br>-no<br>-no<br>-no<br>animation/illustration student<br><br>It does solve the issue of needing to put stickers on the lens. If you want clarity the routes need indication of wire colour somehow maybe. But idk. My opinion might change seeing it physically.<br>Colours only help me cause i sort of know what they mean already. If someone didnt have that context then you have to provide it too it quickly gets out of scope i guess. Some way to differentiate the routes appearance might still help since the pads are marked on the board<br>graphic designer<br><br>-Yes, I think it would. However I will say if it relied on what for me would be unintuitive knowledge, perhaps less so. As in if I needed to rely on being told how it worked in order to understand what it looks like when it&#39;s on/off, I&#39;d be less likely to trust it than my historical resolution of taping over the camera<br></span><span class="c7">- </span><span class="c3">Yes, moreso than otherwise. Makes me want to point at things and ask what they are<br></span><span class="c7">- </span><span class="c3">No, the artiface of a casing and how it is typically presented is a visual language I better understand. I can see two different webcam cases and be able to ascertain from their aesthetics, I couldn&#39;t with just the innards<br>works for a union<br><br></span><span class="c7">- </span><span class="c3">i think i would more if i could pick it up and prod it a bit while it was operating, but yes moreso<br></span><span class="c7">- </span><span class="c3">definitely and it makes me want to see the circuitboard a bit more blown up too<br></span><span class="c7">- </span><span class="c3">and yes she is friendlier than the ordinary webcam<br>programmer</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Almost everybody answered yes to the second question</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Only 3 people said they feel like they understand the webcam better seeing it this way, 1 said sort of</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Only 3 people said they would feel less anxious around webcams presented in this way, and 2 of those 3 people had conditions; like being able to pick it up and prod it, or if it had to be explained to them they would have rather just covered up the lens</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">APPENDIX 2</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">About Intrigue</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Again showed people pictures of the prototypes ive made and asked them a new question:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><ul class="c8 lst-kix_3si26hn2q74w-0 start"><li class="c2 c9 c11 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">these models are meant to investigate what sort of features people are most intrigued by that would make them want to investigate the object.</span></li></ul><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c1">out of the 3 ive made so far, what one makes you want to investigate it more?</span></p><p class="c0 c9"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><a id="t.5fe1eca6f781fb86ebf5201569bbb26fb1a355f2"></a><a id="t.0"></a><table class="c13"><tr class="c14"><td class="c10" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c6"><span class="c3">i think the more wirey ones make me want to fiddle with it more. this one is very cute tho. but i think the first one was more intriguing<br>game designer<br><br>the second one (first of the two posted today) seems like something i would want to investigate. no the second one that looks like the teabag is my choice. seems friendlier<br>musician <br><br>i like the bottom one more. i am somewhat curious about the first one but something about the fabric type turns me off. maybe cause it just looks like a big teabag? Unsure<br>programmer<br><br>out of the three I still think the first one is the most intriguing. maybe I&#39;d use the last one as a sort of art piece but it doesn&#39;t really make me want to investigate it. the first one is the only one I would recognise as like something I could take apart. but if you mean as an intriguing design generally I prefer the last one<br>programmer <br><br>I like the 3rd one. Looks like the alien from nope<br>Graphic designer<br><br>they look like little creatures! i&#39;m extremely loving that, that puts these two above the first one you showed me.<br>then of these two, i think i like the shape of the second one more. i&#39;m assuming the colours at the end denote the wires that would connect there?<br>them having a personality is a feature imo. that helps.<br>the shapes, too. 3 has the right combo of rounded and spiky.<br>though 2 has the most visual simplicity in the wiring, and conveys better what&#39;s going where, i am still more drawn to 3 and would follow its wires if she wasn&#39;t doing her best with the glue. <br>i want to pick them up and rotate them. the first one i want to set down and look at it from different angles by moving myself.<br>it&#39;s hard i really can&#39;t get over how they look like friends<br>3 would fly around and 2 would dangle like a spider. i don&#39;t think 2 did anything wrong if anything it might have done it better for the simplicity but i want 3 to follow me around and become a pet<br>graphic designer<br><br>(3rd) I find him very intriguing. What&#39;s the deal with all these wires? what does he want? how can I please him?<br>(2nd) this one I don&#39;t find quite so in need of investigation bc I can kind of see what&#39;s going on inside and it doesn&#39;t seem as exciting as the coil guy after<br>(1st) this one has a sort of sparsity that is interesting, like it wouldn&#39;t be immediately obvious to me what it does which would make me want to understand<br>works for a union<br><br>so I don&#39;t know if this is like how most people feel or not, but the mousetrap vibes of the first one make me very curious<br>(3rd) this one makes me curious too I want to like look all around it to follow the path of the metal loops<br>(2nd) this one least curious I think bc the mesh obscures me looking at it a little but that might be different depending on particular material and also in person it might be more intriguing than by images<br>programmer </span></p></td></tr></table><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">People liked the 1st and 3rd one generally.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Of the 2nd one, people said that it was simple and conveyed the wiring well, but the 3rd one makes them want to follow the wiring more.
